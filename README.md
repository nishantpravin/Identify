# Identify
Bitespeed Backend Task: Identity Reconciliation 
Identify

## Getting Started

To run the application with Docker, make sure you have Docker installed on your machine. Then, execute the following commands:

1. Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker-compose build
'''
Start the application and its dependencies:
'''bash
docker-compose up
'''

The identify endpoint will be accessible at: http://localhost:5000/identify


With these changes, your Node.js application with TypeScript and SQLite should be fully dockerized and runnable with a single `docker-compose up` command.
